## Hello world!

My name is Ricardo Martins, and this blog is my memory dump. I call it that because it's my memory assistant. It's frustrating when I spend hours learning something cool that, in about three months, maybe even less, I can't remember anymore.

Inspired by the article "[Do things, write about it]((http://mdswanson.com/blog/2013/08/11/write-things-tell-people.html))" it's just another way to write a bit about my everyday life. This is how I've been maintaining [my blog in Brazilian Portuguese](https://ricardomartins.com.br) since 2007.


### Who is Ricardo?

Ricardo was born in Niterói, Brazil, on December 31, 1984.

* He is a reservedly conventional, multitasker, father of three amazing children, and a lucky husband.
* He is able to work consistently, meticulously, and deliberately, and has the persistence to follow through on a task until it is completed.
* He is also cooperative, cautious, detailed, and organized.

### How does he do it?

Ricardo is a multitasker, but he is also single-focused. He takes one thing at a time, in its own time. He is not afraid of what he does not know, and he enjoys challenges. In fact, he needs them, because money is not worth dedicating 1/3 of his day to something that does not have emotion.

### What does he do in life?

In short, Ricardo is a IT professional with over 20 years of experience. He has a special interest in:

* Cloud computing
* DevOps
* Cloud Operations
* Reliability engineering
* Infrastructure as code
* Content development

He is an infrastructure engineer who 11 years ago made a made a significant shift from traditional systems administrator roles to the dynamic world of cloud and DevOps.

Like many sysadmins without a background in programming, I found myself navigating the challenging transition from basic shell scripting to mastering infrastructure as code and complex pipelines. This journey wasn't just about acquiring new skills; it was about embracing a new mindset. I became a passionate advocate for the DevOps culture, recognizing it as the essential path for modern infrastructure engineers.

My experience has taught me the importance of bridging the gap between infrastructure and software development. It's not just about being a developer; it's about understanding developers' needs and delivering solutions that are simple, autonomous, and efficient.

## Getting into Details

Talking about yourself is complicated, especially on the internet where no one is exactly as they appear because we choose our best qualities, the best photos, we all have friends, etc.

I'm just one of those you pass by on the street and don't even notice, who sits next to you on the bus, and you don't even remember, but I'm someone... who?

I'm like you: I like many things and don't like some, I know some things and don't know many, I like many and don't like some, I have my feet on the ground and my head in the clouds.

In short, I'm ordinary, but I'm me, and I'm unique.

I don't smoke, don't drink, don't play soccer, don't talk about soccer, can't dance. I can't live without my wife, children, and family. The rest, I chase after...

I'm a persistent, focused, detail-oriented, organized, simple, responsible, understanding, peacemaker. I'm also forgetful and a bit slow, absent-minded even...

I'm the kind of person who is compulsive about music, who sings badly, but sings anyway...

I'm the kind of person who finds silent movies boring and doesn't find Charles Chaplin funny. The kind of person who drowns ice cream in syrup, who detests lemons. I'm the type who enters the cinema from the opposite side, sits right in the middle, and spends the entire movie eating popcorn, candy, pizza...

I send letters, cards, notes, messages that say "I love you." I'm the type with a dust allergy who avoids hills. I have no patience for hypocrisy, get irritated in traffic, and criticize fanaticism.

I'm the clumsy type who trips over things and spills juice on the table. A good-humored, grateful, and content type of person who calms down with the sunset. I'm the demanding, detail-oriented type.

I'm the type who can't stand to see anyone sad, who loves childhood nostalgia, who's up for anything to make a friend smile. I create a family tree, avoid fights, and only sleep with the lights off.

But I'm also the type who believes in God, who watches the moon rise, who loves thunderstorms, and who can't live without the sea nearby just to admire the waves coming and going and trying to understand how it all works.

I'm the type of person who always thinks things can get better and who loves a sincere compliment. Someone who seeks recognition, hates complaints, and knows nothing about science. The type who doesn't care about fashion but cares about well-being. The kind who makes a thousand plans for the future, who cares more about learning to like what they do than doing what they like because we can't always do everything we want.

I manage systems, type without looking at the keyboard, check emails all day, always stay connected, and keep updating.

That kind of person who isn't the best at what they do but does it with discipline and consistency.

But despite all this, I'm just like you, the kind of person who just wants to be happy!

But none of what was said matters because after this life, we'll have that meeting with God. And He'll only ask five questions:

- What kind of spouse were you?
- Did you bring out the best in your spouse or the worst?
- What kind of mother, father, or child were you?
- Were you honest in all your dealings with the human race?
- Did you change the human condition for the better?

Notice that none of these questions are about how much you achieved, whether you had an imported car or a mansion. That won't be asked. What's important are these five questions. Think about it and reflect on your actions.
