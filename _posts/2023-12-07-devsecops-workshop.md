Just sharing an awesome learning resource I found recently. It will introduce you to the application development cycle leveraging OpenShiftâ€™s tooling & features with a special focus on securing your environment using Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes (ACS). You will get a brief introduction in several OpenShift features like OpenShift Pipelines, OpenShift GitOps, and OpenShift DevSpaces.
